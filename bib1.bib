abstract = "The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is one of the most widely used measures of forecast accuracy, due to its advantages of scale-independency and interpretability. However, MAPE has the significant disadvantage that it produces infinite or undefined values for zero or close-to-zero actual values. In order to address this issue in MAPE, we propose a new measure of forecast accuracy called the mean arctangent absolute percentage error (MAAPE). MAAPE has been developed through looking at MAPE from a different angle. In essence, MAAPE is a slope as an angle, while MAPE is a slope as a ratio, considering a triangle with adjacent and opposite sides that are equal to an actual value and the difference between the actual and forecast values, respectively. MAAPE inherently preserves the philosophy of MAPE, overcoming the problem of division by zero by using bounded influences for outliers in a fundamental manner through considering the ratio as an angle instead of a slope. The theoretical properties of MAAPE are investigated, and the practical advantages are demonstrated using both simulated and real-life data."

abstract="The focus of this study is to explore the statistical distribution models of high-speed railway (HSR) train delays. Based on actual HSR operational data, the delay causes and their classification, delay frequency, number of affected trains, and space--time delay distributions are discussed. Eleven types of delay events are classified, and a detailed analysis of delay distribution for each classification is presented. Models of delay probability delay probability distribution for each cause are proposed. Different distribution functions, including the lognormal, exponential, gamma, uniform, logistic, and normal distribution, were selected to estimate and model delay patterns. The most appropriate distribution, which can approximate the delay duration corresponding to each cause, is derived. Subsequently, the Kolmogorov--Smirnov (K--S) test was used to test the goodness of fit of different train delay distribution models and the associated parameter values. The test results show that the distribution of the test data is consistent with that of the selected models. The fitting distribution models show the execution effect of the timetable and help in finding out the potential conflicts in real-time train operations.",

    abstract = "{Despite the fact that punctuality is an advantage of rail travel compared with other long-distance transport, train delays often occur. For this study, a three-month dataset of weather, train delay and train schedule records was collected and analysed in order to understand the patterns of train delays and to predict train delay time. We found that in severe weather train delays are determined mainly by the type of bad weather, while in ordinary weather the delays are determined mainly by the historical delay time and delay frequency of trains. Identifying the factors closely correlated with train delays, we developed a machine-learning model to predict the delay time of each train at each station. The prediction model is useful not only for passengers wishing to plan their journeys more reliably, but also for railway operators developing more efficient train schedules and more reasonable pricing plans.}",

abstract = {Abstract Delay prediction is an important issue associated with train timetabling and dispatching. Based on real-world operation records, accurate forecasting of delays is of immense significance in train operation and decisions of dispatchers. In this study, we established a model that illustrates the interaction between train delays and their affecting factors via train describer records on a Dutch railway line. Based on the main factors that affect train delay and the time series trend, we determined the independent and dependent variables. A long short-term memory (LSTM) prediction model in which the actual delay time corresponded to the dependent variable was established via Python. Finally, the prediction accuracy of the random forest model and artificial neural network model was compared. The results indicated that the LSTM model outperformed the other two models.},

abstract = "In this paper we present a stochastic model for predicting the propagation of train delays based on Bayesian networks. This method can efficiently represent and compute the complex stochastic inference between random variables. Moreover, it allows updating the probability distributions and reducing the uncertainty of future train delays in real time under the assumption that more information continuously becomes available from the monitoring system. The dynamics of a train delay over time and space is presented as a stochastic process that describes the evolution of the time-dependent random variable. This approach is further extended by modelling the interdependence between trains that share the same infrastructure or have a scheduled passenger transfer. The model is applied on a set of historical traffic realisation data from the part of a busy corridor in Sweden. We present the results and analyse the accuracy of predictions as well as the evolution of probability distributions of event delays over time. The presented method is important for making better predictions for train traffic, that are not only based on static, offline collected data, but are able to positively include the dynamic characteristics of the continuously changing delays."

abstract = "Dynamical systems that contain moving objects generate multi-attribute data, including static, time-series, and spatiotemporal formats. The diversity of the data formats creates challenges for the accurate modeling of these systems, for example, the state/location/trajectory prediction of moving objects. We developed a deep learning (DL) approach that combines 3-dimensional convolutional neural networks (3D CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network, and fully-connected neural network (FCNN) architectures to address this problem. The proposed model, named CLF-Net, uses individual factors with different attributes as input to achieve better predictions. The spatiotemporal features are fed into the 3D CNN, the time-series variables are fed into the LSTM, and the non-time-series factors are fed into the FCNN, respectively. A case study of train delay prediction for four railway lines with different operational features shows that the CLF-Net outperforms conventional machine learning models and the state-of-the-art DL models with regard to the performance metrics of the root mean squared error and mean absolute error."
